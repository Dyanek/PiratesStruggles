    <h2 class="supposedTitle">What the game really is</h2>
    
    <p>
        <span class="piratesStrugglesLogo">Pirates' struggle</span> is a kind of strategic survival in a pirate universe game.
        The main concept is simple: you are a capitain of a pirates' ship, you must attack the enemy pirates' ship and survive as long as possible.
        during the next fight.
    </p>

    <p>
        I wanted to do more than a managment game so I took a simple idea of fighting against other enemy ships with a turn-based combat system like <i>Pokemon</i>, <i>Final Fantasy</i> or
        <i>Sid Meier's Civilization VI</i>. With this kind of system, the player can take his time to think about what possibilities he has to win the fights with the less losses possible,
        the score will be calculated on the number of turns the player survived in a party. The fights will have 2 issues:
        <ul>
            <li>Defeat - the game is over, the player can retry a new game to do a better score.</li>
            <li>Victory - the player returns to the sea and can attack a new ship.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The parties are supposed to be finite, the player will try to do the best score he can make in a single party.
        He will feel happy when he defeats the enemies, he will be disappointed when he loses against other pirates.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game is composed of two kinds of phases:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sail to the sea with your crew, you can control your shit and collide other ships to fight them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fight: the player will fight against an enemy ship's crew, the purpose is obviously trying to survive this fight. This isan interface with texts and animations depending
                on the chosen actions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        The game has less features that what's been imagined at the beginning. Technically, what was imagined was only text selection, but more features are present in this version: a system 
        of sprites movement, tweens effects, <a href="https://github.com/Dyanek/PiratesStruggles.git" id="gitHubLink">project attatched to a GitHub repository</a> etc... I consider the game made as a success.

        <span class="piratesStrugglesLogo">Pirates' struggle</span> is a kind of strategic survival in a pirate universe game.
        The main concept is simple: you are a capitain of a pirates' ship and you must manage your crew with some given resources, they will affect your members' comportments and actions
        for the future of the game. The resources can be stuff like weapons, drink and food e.g. if you give too much wine to a member then he will have a high percentage of missed attacks
        during the next fight.

        </ul>
    </p>

        The parties are supposed to be finite, the player will try to do the best score he can make in a single party.
        He will feel happy when he defeats the enemies and see the good effects of the given resources, he will be disappointed when he’s too greedy or does mistakes with the resources.

        The game is composed of two kinds of phases:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Management: the player will manage his crew, he distributes (or not) the available resources of the ship to his crew. He decides what actions to do for exemple what direction he
                has to take. This will be a simple interface with some texts describing the possibilities you can choose.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fight: the player will fight against an enemy ship, the purpose is obviously trying to survive this fight and if it is possible with as little as losses as possible. This will be
                an interface with texts and animations depending on the chosen actions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        For the first version of the game, only basic features will be available such as: eating, drinking, equipping  basic weapons (swords), simple attacks. Depending on the time it takes to
        develop the game, many other features will be implemented like an account management, a ranking system, new kinds of weapons (pistols), random events happening to the crew e.g. being
        caught in a storm...
